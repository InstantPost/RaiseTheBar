				While we are a much larger team of individuals and startups, we should take note of Heros among us like Aayush Basavesh, Co-founder at Xtrogenesis Technology, and Shakthivel R who help the initiative in Bangalore with On ground support. They are helping with procurement, logistics, donations, and everything else that needs to happen in person. Each of their contributions involves the risk of infection, and it's important to recognize what they are doing for the whole initiative.

				RaiseTheBar would like to invoke the 3D printing community across the country to join the initiative to create the largest possible distributed manufacturing setup to fight COVID. Check the projects tab to learn more about our production process. We are releasing as many details as we can for everyone else to start the organized manufacturing of 3D printed face shields.


				We are being joined by Startups and Individuals every day to fulfill all kinds of roles like engineering, designing, software, medical advice, marketing, and many others. Join us today by posting on the volunteers or 3D-Printers tab and help in whatever way possible at your end to expand our production capability.

				We are doing our bit by developing this free to dashboard to connect all of us together.
			  </p>
			  <h4>Why?</h4>
			  <p class="largerIntro">
				It's important to have publicly accessible information for people who are searching for it<br>
				Lack of information means lack of competition which leads to increase in prices of essential commodities<br>
				Doctors and other essential services staff like doctors have no clue about cost of production so cannot negoatiate<br>
				There is a huge gap between demand and supply of essential goods for medical staff, which is putting pressure on doctors to work in unsafe conditions
			  </p>
			  <h4>How?</h4>
			  <p class="largerIntro">
				RaiseTheBar is a digital dashboard that works as ecommerce portal for COVID suppliers to showcase their capabilities and inventory. Please use the Manufacturers tab to showcase.<br>
				RaiseTheBar is a digital dashboard that works as reverse ecommerce portal for doctors to post their COVID specific requirements for suppliers and manufactures to contact them. Please use the Doctors tab to highlight your requirements.<br>
				RaiseTheBar is a digital dashboard that works as reverse ecommerce portal for everyone else to post their COVID specific requirements for suppliers and manufactures to contact them. Please use the requirements tab if you not a doctor.<br>
				RaiseTheBar is an initiative to share the complete production process and the cost of production for everyone to make sure doctors are aware of it and can properly decide how much they should be paying for it<br>
				RaiseTheBar is an initiative to bring the best out of the 3D printing community in India to help doctors.
			  </p>
			  <h4>What?</h4>
			  <p class="largerIntro">
				We have set up the minimum dashboard at InstantPost and are adding more volunteer support to improve the dashboard. If you want to join us, please post your details on the Volunteers tab and we will contact you as more help is needed.<br>
				We have set up a minimum team of doctors and mechanical designers who are designing the minimum possible tools and equipment that can be easily 3D printed. We are adding these designs and also the ones we find in open source on the projects tab. If you are a mechanical designer or doctor who wants to join, please post your details on the volunteers tab and we will contact you as more help is needed.<br>
				At InstantPost, we are dedicating the complete 3D printing capacity to print 1 face shield frame every 5 minutes. All these frames as part of the RaiseTheBar initiative will be donated to doctors, hospitals, police and other relevant individuals who are right now working on the frontline fighting COVID-19.

				  At Raise the Bar, we have always stood by our values of contribution, creation and cooperation to overcome every hurdle that comes our way. However, things move differently when we have bigger challenges to address and making resources accessible to those in need irrespective of the donations and availability of funds.
				</p>
				<p class="largerIntro">
				  Thus, after putting a lot of thought behind making shields available across boundaries - we’ve zeroed down upon a basic pricing model to cater individual and organisational requirements, alike and thus - making the initiative more universal and relevant to the common interest. So, now when you stumble upon Raise the Bar - you will be able to get the shields shipped directly to your address irrespective of our emphasis upon contribution - because we understand that the disease doesn’t understand the cause nor does it waits for the same.
				</p>
				<p class="largerIntro">
				  So, now when you post a requirement - and make a payment, be rest assured that the shields will reach you irrespective  of the barriers of boundaries and logistics.
				</p>
				<p class="largerIntro">
				  The process is continuous, but then - worth it. Moreover, we’ll be keeping a reasonable profit on every shield sold because it is important to drive the initiative in a way that is self sustaining and not dependent upon external factors for its operations.
