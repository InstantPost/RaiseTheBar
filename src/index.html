                    <h2 class="title is-2">Why ?</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>It's important to have <b>publicly accessible information</b> for people who are searching
                            for it</li>
                        <li>Lack of information means lack of competition which is leading <b>increase in prices</b> of
                            essential commodities</li>
                        <li>Doctors and other essential services staff like doctors have no clue about <b>cost of
                                production</b> so cannot negoatiate</li>
                        <li>There is a <b>huge gap between demand and supply</b> of essential goods for medical staff,
                            which is putting pressure on doctors to work in unsafe conditions</li>
                    </ul>

                    <ul>
                        <li>We have setup the minimum dashboard at InstantPost and add more volunteered support to
                            improve the dashboard. If you want to join us please post your details on the volunteers tab
                            and we will contact as more help is needed.</li>
                        <li>We have setup a minimum team of doctors and mechanical designers who are designing the
                            minimum possible tools and equiments that can be easily 3D printed. We are adding these
                            designs and also the ones we find opensourced on the commodities tab. If you are a
                            mechanical designer or doctor who want to join, please post your details on the volunteers

                            cutting machines and punching to build face shields. If you happen to be manufacturer or
                            supplier for medical supplies or material, please post your details on the Manufacturers

                        <li>At InstantPost, we are dedicating the complete 3D printing capacity to print 1 face shield
                            frame every 5 minutes. All these frames as part of the <b>RaiseTheBar</b> initiative will be
                            donated to doctors, hospitals, police and other relevant individuals who are right now
                            working on the frontline fighting COVID <br /><br />
                            India already operates at scale the world does not even plan for ! We need to print 1000s of
                            face shields every minute across India to make them available across India for the
                            frontliners. I would like to invoke the 3D printing community across the country to join us
                            inthe RaiseTheBar initiative to create the largest possible distributed manufacturing setup
                            to fight COVID.
